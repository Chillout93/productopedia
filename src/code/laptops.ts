        <strong>CPU:</strong>  Nowadays you will mostly see Intel CPUs in the format iX-Xxxx, the first X will be a 3, 5, 7 or 9 with the higher number being a stronger \
        processor. The second X determines the generation, so an i7-8110 is an i7 processor from the 8th generation. The generation includes architecture improvements over time <source /> \
        you should expect a higher generation i5 to outperform a lower generation i7 for example. The best way to compare processors is through benchmarks <a href=\"https://www.cpubenchmark.net/laptop.html\">here</a>. \
        </p> \
        <p> \
            <strong>RAM: </strong> RAM is quite cheap and you should be looking for at least 8GB even for lower end laptops, 16GB for more mid-level. The more information your computer can hold in ram \
            over storage the faster it can access the information, so ideally for all the applications you are using at one time it should be able to hold all that in memory, or \
            you should expect severe performance degredation. \
        </p> \
        <p> \
            <strong>Storage: </strong> Try and avoid hard disks where possible, look for laptops with \"SSD\" over \"Hard Disk\" as these will allow your computer to turn on \
            faster and overall create the sense that your laptop is a lot faster than it really is. If you require a lot of storage which you don't access frequently then \
            we recommend just getting external hard drives to hold photos or videos. \
        </p> \
        <p> \
            <strong>Graphics Card: </strong> You only need a dedicated graphics card if you plan to do gaming otherwise it will be encorporated onto the motherboard, try and \
            avoid laptops with dedicated graphics cards unless you plan to do gaming, in which case you should look at benchmarks to determine the best forming ones. \
